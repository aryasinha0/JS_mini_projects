# Projects description

### i. Tip Calculator
- In this project, our aim is to build a modern tip calculator. The project's primary interface comprises a container labeled "Tip Calculator" with two input fields: one for the bill amount and the other for the tip percentage. The tip calculator has a modern design that is styled using CSS. We utilized JavaScript to obtain the values of the two input fields and calculate the total amount based on these values.

### ii. Temperature Converter
- A simple web app built with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript. It has three input fields for Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin. Changing any one field instantly updates the other two in real time. The project uses event listeners, event.target.id, parseFloat(), and .toFixed() for calculations, with Bootstrap styling for a clean layout.
